This is not a complete mod, it depends on BaseMod, ModTheSpire, as well as SlayTheSpire source code.

You can follow the steps to set up a mod here: https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/wiki/Getting-Started-(For-Modders)

This file will simply plug and play once you have completed those steps.

Thanks, happy modding!
